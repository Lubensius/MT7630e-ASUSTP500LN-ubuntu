This is work in progress on low resources (nice 20 ;-) ) , but feel free to include changes in active your development. 
Changes:
* Add possibility to disable excessive logging.
* Fixed stack overflow due to self recursion in interrupt handler

Open Points:
* WiFi Signal Quality doesn't report correctly (always full reading)
* Sometimes (rare) NOP after suspend, but also maybe ubuntu issue.
